# This project has the objective of making the arduino emitt a sound when the computer it is attached to through USB gets Internet connection.

Requirements:

-Arduino board<br />
-USB Cable Type A/B<br />
-Passive buzzer <br />
-2 DuPont Wires Male to Female<br />

Instructions:

-Build the arduino circuit diagram<br />
-Connect the arduino through the USB Cable Type A/B to the PC <br />
-Download the .ino and .py file and change in both the "COM5" port to the one your arduino is using in your PC (Go to "Device Manager" in Windows to check it out")<br />
-Transfer the .ino file program to the arduino <br />
-Execute Python code<br />

Now when there is Internet connection the arduino will make the passive buzzer emitt a sound
